## How does it work

- Jetindexer monitors sitemaps multiple times per day
- When a new page is detected or updated page, it makes a new request to Google Web Indexing API
- On a weekly basis, it sends requests to Webmaster API (Search Console API) in order to check the indexing status
- Sends weekly or monthly reports with a digest of indexing
